# markdown.lua
This is an implementation of the popular text markup language Markdown in pure Lua. Markdown can convert documents written in a simple and easy to read text format to well-formatted HTML.

I (develephant) did not make this module, I am simply archiving it, as it is a pretty good Pure Lua Markdown parser, though a bit outdated.
